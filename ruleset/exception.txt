String rule:
- Normal day: natural-language string literals are FORBIDDEN.
- Exception day: EXACTLY ONE natural-language string literal is allowed.
- On exception day: that ONE string must NOT explain the rules, not a diary, not an emotional statement.
  It should behave like a trace, a label, a glitch, or a token.
- Do not announce that today is an exception day inside the code.
