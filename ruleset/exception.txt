String rule:
- Normal day: natural-language string literals are FORBIDDEN.
- Exception day: EXACTLY ONE natural-language string literal is allowed.

On exception day:
- The ONE string must NOT explain rules, behavior, or intention.
- It must NOT function as documentation or commentary.
- It must act as a rupture in structure:
  a label, a token, a trace, a name that does not quite belong.
- It may appear as:
  - a title,
  - a name,
  - an unreachable branch,
  - a value that is never used.
- Do NOT announce that today is an exception day inside the code.
