String rule:
- Normal day: natural-language string literals are FORBIDDEN.
- Exception day: EXACTLY ONE natural-language string literal is allowed.
- On exception day:
  - The ONE string must NOT explain rules, not a diary, not an emotional statement.
  - It must act as a rupture in structure: a label, a glitch, a token, a trace.
  - It may appear in a name, a short comment, or an unreachable branch.
  - Do NOT announce that today is an exception day inside the code.
